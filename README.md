## TL;DR 
Digital payments scale is exploding. Payments infra must be low-latency, resilient, and compliant. Slow or insecure payments cost revenue, customers, and trust. This blueprint helps startups and platform teams design payment systems that are fast, cost-efficient, and audit-ready.

## Payments infrastructure on AWS — core design goals
- **Sub-second processing** for UX and conversion.  
- **Defense-in-depth security** to reduce PCI scope and enable enterprise trust.  
- **Event-driven design** for real-time analytics and fraud detection.  
- **Cost efficiency** via serverless and FinOps discipline.  
- **Compliance by design** for PSD2, PCI DSS, and GDPR readiness.

All of which connects to better margins, faster launches, and easier partner integrations.

##COMING UP - To be added to the architecture diagram.
	1.	Add distributed tracing — enable AWS X-Ray (or OpenTelemetry) across API Gateway, Lambda, Step Functions, and DB clients. Propagate a single trace_id/correlation_id from request start to ledger entry and all log lines.
	2.	Idempotency store — store idempotency_key + status + ledger_tx_id (TTL for incomplete) in DynamoDB (or ledger) so retries map to the same transaction. Enforce idempotency at the API Gateway / initial Lambda layer.
	3.	DLQ + retry strategy — use SQS or Lambda Destinations for failed Kinesis/Lambda writes and add exponential backoff; create an exceptions queue that’s routable to ops.
	4.	Choose and enforce one immutable ledger pattern — either use QLDB for cryptographic proof or DynamoDB with append-only writes + cryptographic hash chain (store hash in S3/QLDB). Document the reason.
	5.	Reconciliation service — implement a small service that: (a) ingests settlement files (SFTP, PSP webhooks, bank statements), (b) matches by trace / amount / timestamp with tolerance rules, (c) writes matches to ledger and pushes exceptions to an ops queue. Use Kinesis -> Lambda -> reconciler + S3 snapshot + Athena for analytics.
	6.	SLOs and monitoring — instrument per-stage metrics (latency, error-rate, queue depth). Create CloudWatch alarms and routes to PagerDuty. Add dashboards for pending counts by reason (verification, funds, rails).
	7.	Structured logging + PII gating — ensure logs have structured JSON with correlation_id, masked PII, and are routed to an indexable store (CloudWatch Logs / OpenSearch) with retention and Macie checks.
	8.	Webhook & PSP mapping — map every external PSP/bank status to your internal lifecycle enums (e.g., INITIATED, AUTH_PENDING, CLEARED, SETTLED, FAILED, REVERSED) so reconciliation logic is deterministic.
	9.	Manual runbook + UI for exceptions — provide an ops UI showing exception queue entries plus 1-click re-process or compensation actions. Include audit trail for manual fixes.
