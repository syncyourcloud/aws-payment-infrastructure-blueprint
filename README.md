UPDATE: Next part in series published - [tokenisation]([https://substack.com/home/post/p-170024315]) Learn how to secure the data before the data enters the DynamoDB table. Architecture diagram update coming soon.

Added the payments processing systems diagram flow.


UPDATE: Read the full technical details [From Lambda to Bedrock - The Architecture Behind Payments]([https://substack.com/home/post/p-169945590/)]. This part in the series integrates the queue agent.


This preview repo is paired with a full in-depth post available to paid subscribers.

Stay tuned for the next part coming up this weekend: UK Faster Payment Systems: Architecting for Compliance. In this part you will receive an understanding of how to approach the compliance with the technical aspect. Follow along here for the series: https://architectsassemble.substack.com/p/uk-faster-payments-architecture-strategic

This is a simplified preview of a production-grade architecture for real-time payment processing, designed using AWS Well-Architected best practices and financial compliance considerations.

Aligns well with the UK FPS and the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

###  AI Agent Layer Coming This Weekend! 

Integration of Amazon Bedrock to support secure, compliant, LLM-based decisioning in the payment orchestration:

- Tokenized input – No PII is exposed
- Logged prompts + responses – for compliance & audits
- Use cases: fraud scoring, routing decisions, regulatory flagging

To understand how AI Agents work here's a popular post: https://blog.syncyourcloud.io/architecting-ai-agent-based-payment-infrastructure-with-aws-bedrock

All AI interactions are optional, isolated, and fully auditable.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Real-time payments require high-throughput, low-latency, always-on infrastructure — but many fintechs are still operating on monoliths, legacy PSP integrations, and fragile cron jobs.

🔹 Need sub-second transaction handling  
🔹 Ensure compliance with PCI DSS, PSD2  
🔹 Eliminate single points of failure  
🔹 Balance cost with performance in unpredictable load spikes

## 📘 Why Cloud-Native on AWS?

- Pay-per-use with serverless compute
- PCI-ready managed services (RDS, DynamoDB, KMS, Cognito)
- Global scaling & disaster recovery patterns
- Event-driven architecture patterns for real-time responsiveness
