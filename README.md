## Payments infrastructure on AWS — core design goals
- **Sub-second processing** for UX and conversion.  
- **Defense-in-depth security** to reduce PCI scope and enable enterprise trust.  
- **Event-driven design** for real-time analytics and fraud detection.  
- **Cost efficiency** via serverless and FinOps discipline.  
- **Compliance by design** for PSD2, PCI DSS, and GDPR readiness.

All of which connects to better margins, faster launches, and easier partner integrations.
